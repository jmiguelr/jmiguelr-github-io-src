Welcome to my brand new blog!. 

As I pretend to write about technologies I use, I cannot imagine a better way to start:

```
 _   _      _ _        __        __         _     _ 
| | | | ___| | | ___   \ \      / /__  _ __| | __| |
| |_| |/ _ \ | |/ _ \   \ \ /\ / / _ \| '__| |/ _` |
|  _  |  __/ | | (_) |   \ V  V / (_) | |  | | (_| |
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/     \_/\_/ \___/|_|  |_|\__,_|
                                                    

```

### Disclaimer: 
I'm a non-english speaker. My spoken english is far to be fluent but I think I can make a good job trying to write it. And it should improve on future, as it's part of what I want ot do with this new blog. 

### What can you find here?
I've been programmer (gwBasic, Clipper, Visual Basic, Perl, Java, Groovy) and systems analyst (or SysOp, SysAdmin, BOFH or whatever you want) since 1985. So I'll write to whatever I find interesting but always related to technical questions. I have [other blog](https://blog.jmiguel.eu) for personal questions and for some time (maybe some day...) I had another one for aviation information: [aerotrastornados.com](http://www.aerotrastornados.com)

### Tagging
All posts will have some tags. First for language [eng **|** esp]. Next for topic, and I'll try to keep the list as short as possible: [programming **|** systems **|** java **|** groovy **|** grails **|** linux]

No more to write right now. Just let's see if I can publish it without further problems before start customization, fonts, images and so on.
